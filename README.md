Flexible REST API Flask with MongoDB üöÄ

üìù Quick Summary A robust and flexible RESTful API built with Flask and Python, designed to manage user data. Its key feature is the ability to dynamically connect to different MongoDB instances based on environment configuration, making it ideal for development, testing, and production.

‚ú® Project Overview This project demonstrates the creation of a complete RESTful API, from data modeling with MongoEngine to exposing endpoints with Flask-RESTful. It emphasizes good development practices, such as separating configurations by environment (allowing flexible MongoDB connections), using Docker for containerization, and writing automated tests with Pytest. The project serves as a practical example to showcase skills in backend development, working with NoSQL databases, and familiarity with the DevOps ecosystem.

üéØ Motivation The main goal was to develop an API that not only fulfilled the functional requirements of a user CRUD but also served as a practical example of how to build Python applications ready for different stages of the development lifecycle. Flexibility in database configuration and integration with Docker were key points to simulate an environment closer to reality.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used Backend: Python 3, Flask, Flask-RESTful

ORM/ODM: MongoEngine (for MongoDB)

Database: MongoDB

Containerization: Docker, Docker Compose

Testing: Pytest

üöÄ Key Features User Management:

Listing of all registered users.

Search for a specific user by their CPF.

Multi-Environment Configuration:

Support for Development, Production, and Testing environments, controlled by the FLASK_ENV variable.

Dynamic connection to the MongoDB instance configured for each environment.

Containerization with Docker:

Dockerfile to build the application image.

docker-compose.yml to orchestrate the application and the MongoDB service in a development environment.

Automated Tests:

Test suite using Pytest to ensure API endpoint functionality.

‚öôÔ∏è Configuration and Installation Follow the steps below to configure and run the project.

Prerequisites Python 3.9 or higher

Pip (Python package manager)

Docker and Docker Compose (Recommended, especially for the default development environment)

Access to a MongoDB instance (for the production environment, usually a cluster on MongoDB Atlas; for development/testing, it can be local or Docker).

Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Recommended) First, create the virtual environment:
python -m venv venv

Then, activate it based on your operating system:

On Linux/macOS:

source venv/bin/activate

On Windows (PowerShell):

.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

On Windows (CMD):

venv\Scripts\activate.bat

Install Dependencies With the virtual environment activated, install the project dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

MongoDB Database Configuration For Development (Docker): The docker-compose.yml already provisions a MongoDB service.
For Development (Local): Ensure you have a MongoDB instance running locally on port 27017 (or adjust DevConfig in config.py).

For Production (MongoDB Atlas):

1. Create a cluster on MongoDB Atlas.

2. Configure the "IP Access List" to allow connections from your IP or 0.0.0.0/0 (for testing, with caution).

3. Create a database user with the necessary permissions.

4. Obtain the connection string (URI) for your cluster.

5. Set the `MONGODB_URI` environment variable to your Atlas connection string. Refer to `README_SECURITY.md` for detailed instructions on using a `.env` file.

6. Set the `FLASK_ENV` environment variable to `production`.

The application's `ProdConfig` is already set up to use the `MONGODB_URI` environment variable.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Security Note:** The default MongoDB credentials and connection details used in development (`DevConfig`, `docker-compose.yml`) and testing (`MockConfig`) configurations are for local convenience ONLY. **DO NOT** use these default credentials in any production environment or any development/testing environment that is publicly accessible. Always use strong, unique credentials for such environments, managed via environment variables.

For Testing: MockConfig points to a local MongoDB on port 27018.

üîß Detailed Environment Configurations The application uses the FLASK_ENV environment variable to determine which set of configurations to load. The init_db function in application/db.py automatically detects whether to use the full Atlas URI (for production) or detailed settings (for development/testing).

ProdConfig (Production):

class ProdConfig: MONGODB_SETTINGS = { 'host': os.getenv('MONGODB_URI') # Atlas URI from environment variable } SECRET_KEY = os.getenv('SECRET_KEY')

MockConfig (Testing):

class MockConfig: MONGODB_DB = 'users_test' MONGODB_HOST = 'localhost' MONGODB_PORT = 27018 MONGODB_USERNAME = os.getenv('MONGODB_TEST_USERNAME', 'test_user') MONGODB_PASSWORD = os.getenv('MONGODB_TEST_PASSWORD', 'test_pass')

üöÄ How to Run the Application The application listens on port 5001 by default, as defined in wsgi.py and docker-compose.yml.

Option 1: Using Docker Compose (Recommended for Easy Development) For Development Environment (MongoDB via Docker): The docker-compose.yml is configured by default for the development environment.

docker-compose up --build

The API will be accessible at http://localhost:5001.

For Production Environment (MongoDB Atlas via Docker):

Ensure your `MONGODB_URI` environment variable is set to your Atlas connection string in your `.env` file.

Edit the docker-compose.yml file and change the environment variable for the api service:

services: api: # ... other configurations ... environment: - FLASK_DEBUG=0 # Recommended for production - FLASK_ENV=production # Change to production - MONGODB_URI=your_atlas_connection_string_here # Add your Atlas URI

Run:

docker-compose up --build

(Optional: You can remove the mongodb service and depends_on from docker-compose.yml if you plan to exclusively use Atlas in this mode).

Option 2: Local Execution (Without Docker) For Development Environment:

On Linux/macOS:

export FLASK_ENV=development # or can be omitted, as it's the default python wsgi.py

On Windows (PowerShell):

$env:FLASK_ENV="development" python wsgi.py

On Windows (CMD):

set FLASK_ENV=development python wsgi.py

For Production Environment:

On Linux/macOS:

export FLASK_ENV=production python wsgi.py

On Windows (PowerShell):

$env:FLASK_ENV="production" python wsgi.py

On Windows (CMD):

set FLASK_ENV=production python wsgi.py

For Testing Environment:

On Linux/macOS:

export FLASK_ENV=testing python wsgi.py # Or run tests directly

On Windows (PowerShell):

$env:FLASK_ENV="testing" python wsgi.py

On Windows (CMD):

set FLASK_ENV=testing python wsgi.py

üß™ Running Tests To run the automated test suite with Pytest:

pytest

(Ensure the testing environment (FLASK_ENV=testing) is configured to use the correct test database, usually on port 27018, as per MockConfig).

üß† Challenges and Learnings Dynamic Environment Configuration: One of the main challenges was implementing a configuration system that allowed easy switching between different databases and other environment-specific settings. This was solved with Flask configuration classes and the use of the FLASK_ENV variable.

Integration with MongoEngine and Flask-RESTful: Learning the best way to model data with MongoEngine and expose it efficiently following RESTful patterns with Flask-RESTful was an important part of the learning process.

Data Validation: Implementing CPF validation, including the verifier digit logic, directly in the API.

Dockerization: Configuring Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml to create a consistent development environment and facilitate deployment.

Automated Testing: Developing the habit of writing tests for API endpoints using Pytest, ensuring code reliability.

üìà Next Steps / Future Improvements Implement authentication and authorization (e.g., JWT) to protect endpoints.

Add endpoints to update (PUT) and delete (DELETE) users.

Improve error handling and feedback to the API client.

Expand test coverage, including more complex integration tests.

Create more interactive API documentation using Swagger/OpenAPI.

Set up a CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery) pipeline to automate tests and deployments.

Add pagination and filters to the GET /users endpoint.

‚öôÔ∏è Key Environment Variables Variable

Possible Values

Description

FLASK_ENV

development, production, testing

Defines which Flask configuration object will be loaded (DevConfig, ProdConfig, MockConfig).

FLASK_DEBUG

0 (off), 1 (on)

Activates or deactivates Flask's debug mode. 0 is recommended for production.

MONGODB_URI

MongoDB connection string

Required for production environment (ProdConfig). Full Atlas connection string for MongoDB Atlas.

MONGODB_DB, MONGODB_HOST, MONGODB_PORT, MONGODB_USERNAME, MONGODB_PASSWORD

(strings, int)

Used by DevConfig and MockConfig to connect to MongoDB, can be overridden by environment variables with the same name.

MONGODB_TEST_USERNAME, MONGODB_TEST_PASSWORD

(strings)

Test environment credentials for MockConfig. Defaults to 'test_user' and 'test_pass' respectively.

üìù Important Notes The default application port is 5001, aligned with the docker-compose.yml configuration.

The init_db function in application/db.py is designed to automatically detect whether to use the Atlas connection string (for ProdConfig) or individual host/port settings (for DevConfig/MockConfig).

For a real production environment, it is crucial to set FLASK_DEBUG=0.

The mongodb service in docker-compose.yml can be removed if you plan to exclusively use MongoDB Atlas, even in development via Docker (by setting FLASK_ENV=production in docker-compose.yml).
